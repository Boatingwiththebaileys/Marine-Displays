Hi, 

I'm in the process of creating marine displays using ESP32 display boards. The idea behind the project is for them to be easy to build, WebUI-driven, but still customisable to give you a polished look and feel to the unit. At the moment im working with two devices, both from Waveshare: 

ESP32-S3 2.8inch Round Display Development Board, 480×480, 32-bit LX7 Dual-core Processor, Supports WiFi & Bluetooth, Options For Touch Function, ESP32 With Display

ESP32-S3 4inch Display Development Board, 480×480, 32-Bit LX7 Dual-Core Processor, Up To 240MHz Frequency, Supports WiFi & Bluetooth, With Onboard Antenna, ESP32 With Display

The round display, i'm focusing more on it, listening to SignalK paths and basically creating some sort of smart display, for different engine information, battery, wind etc.

For the square display, the plan is to focus on NMEA2000 as it has a built-in CAN interface. That will hopefully give you options to select which data you would like to see.

Its all avilable for free here, try it, test, tell me what works.

Videos and more coming soon.
